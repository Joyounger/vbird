on how you can use Unicode/UTF-8 on POSIX systems (Linux, Unix). You
will find here both introductory information for every user, as well as
detailed references for the experienced developer.</b>

</p><p><b>Unicode now replaces ASCII, ISO 8859 and EUC at all levels. It

</p><p><b>With the UTF-8 encoding, Unicode can be used in a convenient and
backwards compatible way in environments that were designed entirely
around ASCII, like Unix. UTF-8 is the way in which Unicode is used
under Unix, Linux, and similar systems. Make sure that you are well
familiar with it and that your software supports UTF-8 smoothly.</b>

<h2 id=3D"ucs">What are UCS and ISO 10646?</h2>

<p>The international standard <b>ISO 10646</b> defines the
<b>Universal Character Set (UCS)</b>. UCS is a superset of all other
character set standards. It guarantees <em>round-trip
compatibility</em> to other character sets. This means simply that no
information is lost if you convert any text string to UCS and then
back to its original encoding.

</p><p>UCS contains the characters required to represent practically all
known languages. This includes not only the Latin, Greek, Cyrillic,
Hebrew, Arabic, Armenian, and Georgian scripts, but also Chinese,
Japanese and Korean Han ideographs as well as scripts such as
Hiragana, Katakana, Hangul, Devanagari, Bengali, Gurmukhi, Gujarati,
Oriya, Tamil, Telugu, Kannada, Malayalam, Thai, Lao, Khmer, Bopomofo,
Tibetan, Runic, Ethiopic, Canadian Syllabics, Cherokee, Mongolian,
Ogham, Myanmar, Sinhala, Thaana, Yi, and others. For scripts not yet
covered, research on how to best encode them for computer usage is
still going on and they will be added eventually. This includes not
only historic scripts such as <a href=3D"http://std.dkuug.dk/jtc1/sc2/wg2/d=
ocs/n1639/n1639.htm">Cuneiform</a>, <a href=3D"http://std.dkuug.dk/jtc1/sc2=
/wg2/docs/n1637/n1637.htm">Hieroglyphs</a> and various Indo-European notati=
ons, but even some
selected artistic scripts such as Tolkien=E2=80=99s <a href=3D"http://std.d=
kuug.dk/jtc1/sc2/wg2/docs/n1641/n1641.htm">Tengwar</a> and <a href=3D"http:=
//std.dkuug.dk/jtc1/sc2/wg2/docs/n1642/n1642.htm">Cirth</a>. UCS also cover=
s a large number of graphical,
typographical, mathematical and scientific symbols, including those
provided by TeX, PostScript, APL, the International Phonetic Alphabet
(IPA), MS-DOS, MS-Windows, Macintosh, OCR fonts, as well as many word
processing and publishing systems. The standard continues to be
maintained and updated. Ever more exotic and specialized symbols and
characters will be added for many years to come.

</p><p>ISO 10646 originally defined a 31-bit character set. The subsets of
2<sup>16</sup> characters where the elements differ (in a 32-bit
integer representation) only in the 16 least-significant bits are
called the <em>planes</em> of UCS.

</p><p>The most commonly used characters, including all those found in
major older encoding standards, have been placed into the first plane
(0x0000 to 0xFFFD), which is called the
<b>Basic Multilingual Plane (BMP)</b> or Plane 0. The characters that
were later added outside the 16-bit BMP are mostly for specialist
applications such as historic scripts and scientific notation. Current
plans are that there will never be characters assigned outside the
21-bit code space from 0x000000 to 0x10FFFF, which covers a bit over
one million potential future characters. The ISO 10646-1 standard was
first published in 1993 and defines the architecture of the character
set and the content of the BMP. A second part ISO 10646-2 was added in
2001 and defines characters encoded outside the BMP. In the 2003
edition, the two parts were combined into a single ISO 10646 standard.
New characters are still being added on a continuous basis, but the
existing characters will not be changed any more and are stable.

</p><p>UCS assigns to each character not only a code number but also an
official name. A hexadecimal number that represents a UCS or Unicode
value is commonly preceded by =E2=80=9CU+=E2=80=9D as in U+0041 for the cha=
racter
=E2=80=9CLatin capital letter A=E2=80=9D. The UCS characters U+0000 to U+00=
7F are
identical to those in US-ASCII (ISO 646 IRV) and the range U+0000 to
U+00FF is identical to ISO 8859-1 (Latin-1). The range U+E000 to
U+F8FF and also larger ranges outside the BMP are reserved for private
use. UCS also defines several methods for encoding a string of
characters as a sequence of bytes, such as UTF-8 and UTF-16.

</p><h2 id=3D"comb">What are combining characters?</h2>

<p>Some code points in UCS have been assigned to <b>combining
characters</b>. These are similar to the non-spacing accent keys on a
typewriter. A combining character is not a full character by itself.
It is an accent or other diacritical mark that is added to the
previous character. This way, it is possible to place any accent on
any character. The most important accented characters, like those used
in the orthographies of common languages, have codes of their own in
UCS to ensure backwards compatibility with older character sets. They
are known as
<b>precomposed characters</b>. Precomposed characters are available in
UCS for backwards compatibility with older encodings that have no
combining characters, such as ISO 8859. The combining-character
mechanism allows one to add accents and other diacritical marks to any
character. This is especially important for scientific notations such
as mathematical formulae and the International Phonetic Alphabet,
where any possible combination of a base character and one or several
diacritical marks could be needed.

</p><p>Combining characters follow the character which they modify. For
example, the German umlaut character =C3=84 (=E2=80=9CLatin capital letter =
A with
diaeresis=E2=80=9D) can either be represented by the precomposed UCS code
U+00C4, or alternatively by the combination of a normal =E2=80=9CLatin capi=
tal
letter A=E2=80=9D followed by a =E2=80=9Ccombining diaeresis=E2=80=9D: U+00=
41 U+0308. Several
combining characters can be applied when it is necessary to stack
multiple accents or add combining marks both above and below the base
character. The Thai script, for example, needs up to two combining
characters on a single base character.

</p><h2 id=3D"levels">What are UCS implementation levels?</h2>

<p>Not all systems can be expected to support all the advanced
mechanisms of UCS, such as combining characters. Therefore, ISO 10646
specifies the following three implementation levels:

</p><dl>

<dt>Level 1</dt><dd>Combining characters and Hangul Jamo characters=20
are not supported.

<br><small>[Hangul Jamo are an alternative representation of
precomposed modern Hangul syllables as a sequence of consonants and
vowels. They are required to fully support the Korean script including
Middle Korean.]</small>

</dd><dt>Level 2</dt><dd>Like level 1, however in some scripts, a fixed lis=
t of
combining characters is now allowed (e.g., for Hebrew, Arabic,
Devanagari, Bengali, Gurmukhi, Gujarati, Oriya, Tamil, Telugo, Kannada,
Malayalam, Thai and Lao). These scripts cannot be represented
adequately in UCS without support for at least certain combining
characters.

</dd><dt>Level 3</dt><dd>All UCS characters are supported, such that, for
example, mathematicians can place a tilde or an arrow (or both) on any
character.

</dd></dl>

<h2 id=3D"national">Has UCS been adopted as a national standard?</h2>

<p>Yes, a number of countries have published national adoptions of ISO
10646, sometimes after adding additional annexes with cross-references
to older national standards, implementation guidelines, and
specifications of various national implementation subsets:

</p><ul>

additional national guidance and clarification on handling the Persian
language and the Arabic script in Unicode.)

</li></ul>

<h2 id=3D"unicode">What is Unicode?</h2>

<p data-find=3D"_4">In the late 1980s, there have been two independent atte=
mpts to
create a single unified character set. One was the ISO 10646 project
of the <a href=3D"http://www.iso.ch/">International Organization for
Standardization (ISO)</a>, the other was the <a href=3D"http://www.unicode.=
org/">Unicode Project</a> organized by a
consortium of (initially mostly US) manufacturers of multi-lingual
software. Fortunately, the participants of both projects realized in
around 1991 that two different unified character sets is not exactly
what the world needs. They joined their efforts and worked together on
creating a single code table. Both projects still exist and publish
their respective standards independently, however the Unicode
Consortium and ISO/IEC JTC1/SC2 have agreed to keep the code tables of
the Unicode and ISO 10646 standards compatible and they closely
coordinate any further extensions. Unicode 1.1 corresponded to ISO
10646-1:1993, Unicode 3.0 corresponded to ISO 10646-1:2000, Unicode
3.2 added ISO 10646-2:2001, and Unicode 4.0 corresponds to ISO
10646:2003, and Unicode 5.0 corresponds to ISO 10646:2003 plus its
amendments 1=E2=80=933. All Unicode versions since 2.0 are compatible, only
new characters will be added, no existing characters will be removed
or renamed in the future.

</p><p>The Unicode Standard can be ordered like any normal book, for
instance via <a href=3D"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0321480910/"=
>amazon.com</a>
for around 60&nbsp;USD:

</p><blockquote>

N/0321480910/">The
Unicode Standard 5.0</a>,<br>

ISBN 0-321-48091-0.
</p></blockquote>

<p>If you work frequently with text processing and character sets, you
definitely should get a copy. Unicode 5.0 is also available <a href=3D"http=
://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode5.0.0/">online</a>.

</p><h2 id=3D"diffs">So what is the difference between Unicode and ISO 1064=
6?</h2>

<p>The <a href=3D"http://www.unicode.org/unicode/standard/standard.html">Un=
icode
Standard</a> published by the Unicode Consortium corresponds to ISO
10646 at implementation level 3. All characters are at the same
positions and have the same names in both standards.

</p><p>The Unicode Standard defines in addition much more semantics
associated with some of the characters and is in general a better
reference for implementors of high-quality typographic publishing
systems. Unicode specifies algorithms for rendering presentation forms
of some scripts (say Arabic), handling of bi-directional texts that
mix for instance Latin and Hebrew, algorithms for sorting and string
comparison, and much more.

</p><p>The ISO 10646 standard on the other hand is not much more than a
simple character set table, comparable to the old ISO 8859 standards.
It specifies some terminology related to the standard, defines some
encoding alternatives, and it contains specifications of how to use
UCS in connection with other established ISO standards such as ISO
6429 and ISO 2022. There are other closely related ISO standards, for
instance <a href=3D"http://dkuug.dk/jtc1/sc22/open/n2933.pdf">ISO
14651</a> on sorting UCS strings. A nice feature of the ISO 10646-1
standard is that it provides CJK example glyphs in five different
style variants, while the Unicode standard shows the CJK ideographs
only in a Chinese variant.

</p><h2 id=3D"utf-8">What is UTF-8?</h2>

<p>UCS and Unicode are first of all just code tables that assign
integer numbers to characters. There exist several alternatives for
how a sequence of such characters or their respective integer values
can be represented as a sequence of bytes. The two most obvious
encodings store Unicode text as sequences of either 2 or 4 bytes
sequences. The official terms for these encodings are UCS-2 and UCS-4,
respectively. Unless otherwise specified, the most significant byte
comes first in these (Bigendian convention). An ASCII or Latin-1 file
can be transformed into a UCS-2 file by simply inserting a 0x00 byte
in front of every ASCII byte. If we want to have a UCS-4 file, we have
to insert three 0x00 bytes instead before every ASCII byte.

</p><p>Using UCS-2 (or UCS-4) under Unix would lead to very severe
problems. Strings with these encodings can contain as parts of many
wide characters bytes like =E2=80=9C\0=E2=80=9D or =E2=80=9C/=E2=80=9D whic=
h have a special meaning in
filenames and other C library function parameters. In addition, the
majority of UNIX tools expects ASCII files and cannot read 16-bit words
as characters without major modifications. For these reasons,
<b>UCS-2</b> is not a suitable external encoding of <b>Unicode</b> in
filenames, text files, environment variables, etc.

</p><p>The <b>UTF-8</b> encoding defined in ISO 10646-1:2000 <a href=3D"htt=
p://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/ucs/ISO-10646-UTF-8.html">Annex D</a> and also =
described in <a href=3D"http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3629.txt">RFC 3629</a> a=
s well as
section 3.9 of the Unicode 4.0 standard does not have these problems.
It is clearly the way to go for using
<b>Unicode</b> under Unix-style operating systems.

</p><p>UTF-8 has the following properties:

</p><ul>

<li>UCS characters U+0000 to U+007F (ASCII) are encoded simply as
bytes 0x00 to 0x7F (ASCII compatibility). This means that files and
strings which contain only 7-bit ASCII characters have the same
encoding under both ASCII and UTF-8.

</li><li>All UCS characters &gt;U+007F are encoded as a sequence of several
bytes, each of which has the most significant bit set. Therefore, no
ASCII byte (0x00-0x7F) can appear as part of any other character.

</li><li>The first byte of a multibyte sequence that represents a non-ASCII
character is always in the range 0xC0 to 0xFD and it indicates how
many bytes follow for this character. All further bytes in a multibyte
sequence are in the range 0x80 to 0xBF. This allows easy

<p>The <i>xxx</i> bit positions are filled with the bits of the
character code number in binary representation. The rightmost <i>x</i>
bit is the least-significant bit. Only the shortest possible multibyte
sequence which can represent the code number of the character can be
used. Note that in multibyte sequences, the number of leading 1 bits
in the first byte is identical to the number of bytes in the entire
sequence.

<p>The official name and spelling of this encoding is UTF-8, where UTF
stands for <b>U</b>CS <b>T</b>ransformation <b>F</b>ormat. Please do
not write UTF-8 in any documentation text in other ways (such as utf8
or UTF_8), unless of course you refer to a variable name and not the

<p><b>An important note for developers of UTF-8 decoding routines:</b>
For security reasons, a UTF-8 decoder <a href=3D"http://www.unicode.org/uni=
code/uni2errata/UTF-8_Corrigendum.html">must
not</a> accept UTF-8 sequences that are longer than necessary to
encode a character. For example, the character U+000A (line feed) must
be accepted from a UTF-8 stream <b>only</b> in the form 0x0A, but not
in any of the following five possible overlong forms:

</p><pre>  0xC0 0x8A
  0xE0 0x80 0x8A
  0xF0 0x80 0x80 0x8A
  0xF8 0x80 0x80 0x80 0x8A
  0xFC 0x80 0x80 0x80 0x80 0x8A
</pre>

<p>Any overlong UTF-8 sequence could be abused to bypass UTF-8
substring tests that look only for the shortest possible encoding. All
overlong UTF-8 sequences start with one of the following byte
patterns:

</p><p></p><table class=3D"solid">

<p>Also note that the code positions U+D800 to U+DFFF (UTF-16
surrogates) as well as U+FFFE and U+FFFF must not occur in normal
UTF-8 or UCS-4 data. UTF-8 decoders should treat them like malformed

<p>The encoding known today as UTF-8 was invented by <a href=3D"http://www.=
cs.bell-labs.com/who/ken/">Ken Thompson</a>. It was
born during the evening hours of 1992-09-02 in a New Jersey diner,
where he designed it in the presence of <a href=3D"http://www.cs.bell-labs.=
com/who/rob/">Rob Pike</a> on a placemat
(see <a href=3D"http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/ucs/utf-8-history.txt">Rob P=
ike=E2=80=99s UTF-8 history</a>). It
replaced an earlier attempt to design a FSS/UTF (file system safe UCS
transformation format) that was circulated in an X/Open working
document in August 1992 by Gary Miller (IBM), Greger Leijonhufvud and
John Entenmann (SMI) as a replacement for the division-heavy UTF-1
encoding from the first edition of ISO 10646-1. By the end of the
first week of September 1992, Pike and Thompson had turned AT&amp;T

<h2 id=3D"ucsutf">What different encodings are there?</h2>

<p>Both the UCS and Unicode standards are first of all large tables
that assign to every character an integer number. If you use the term
=E2=80=9CUCS=E2=80=9D, =E2=80=9CISO 10646=E2=80=9D, or =E2=80=9CUnicode=E2=
=80=9D, this just refers to a mapping
between characters and integers. This does not yet specify how to
store these integers as a sequence of bytes in memory.

</p><p>ISO 10646-1 defines the UCS-2 and UCS-4 encodings. These are
sequences of 2 bytes and 4 bytes per character, respectively. ISO
10646 was from the beginning designed as a 31-bit character set (with
possible code positions ranging from U-00000000 to U-7FFFFFFF),
however it took until 2001 for the first characters to be assigned
beyond the Basic Multilingual Plane (BMP), that is beyond the first
2<sup>16</sup> character positions (see ISO 10646-2 and <a href=3D"http://w=
ww.unicode.org/unicode/reports/tr27/">Unicode 3.1</a>).
UCS-4 can represent all UCS and Unicode characters, UCS-2 can
represent only those from the BMP (U+0000 to U+FFFF).

</p><p>=E2=80=9CUnicode=E2=80=9D originally implied that the encoding was U=
CS-2 and it
initially didn=E2=80=99t make any provisions for characters outside the BMP
(U+0000 to U+FFFF). When it became clear that more than 64k characters
would be needed for certain special applications (historic alphabets
and ideographs, mathematical and musical typesetting, etc.), Unicode
was turned into a sort of 21-bit character set with possible code
points in the range U-00000000 to U-0010FFFF. The 2=C3=971024 surrogate
characters (U+D800 to U+DFFF) were introduced into the BMP to allow
1024=C3=971024 non-BMP characters to be represented as a sequence of
two 16-bit surrogate characters. This way <a href=3D"http://www.cl.cam.ac.u=
k/~mgk25/ucs/ISO-10646-UTF-16.html">UTF-16</a> was born, which represents
the extended =E2=80=9C21-bit=E2=80=9D Unicode in a way backwards compatible=
 with
UCS-2. The term <a href=3D"http://www.unicode.org/unicode/reports/tr19/">UT=
F-32</a> was
introduced in Unicode to describe a 4-byte encoding of the extended
=E2=80=9C21-bit=E2=80=9D Unicode. UTF-32 is the exact same thing as UCS-4, =
except that
by definition UTF-32 is never used to represent characters above
U-0010FFFF, while UCS-4 can cover all 2<sup>31</sup> code positions up
to U-7FFFFFFF. The ISO 10646 working group has agreed to modify their
standard to exclude code positions beyond U-0010FFFF, in order to turn
the new UCS-4 and UTF-32 into practically the same thing.

</p><p>In addition to all that, <a href=3D"http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/u=
nicode.html#utf-8">UTF-8</a> was introduced
to provide an ASCII backwards compatible multi-byte encoding. The
definitions of UTF-8 in UCS and Unicode differed originally slightly,
because in UCS, up to 6-byte long UTF-8 sequences were possible to
represent characters up to U-7FFFFFFF, while in Unicode only up to
4-byte long UTF-8 sequences are defined to represent characters up to
U-0010FFFF. (The difference was in essence the same as between UCS-4
and UTF-32.)

</p><p>No endianess is implied by the encoding names UCS-2, UCS-4, UTF-16,
and UTF-32, though ISO 10646-1 says that Bigendian should be preferred
unless otherwise agreed. It has become customary to append the letters
=E2=80=9CBE=E2=80=9D (Bigendian, high-byte first) and =E2=80=9CLE=E2=80=9D =
(Littleendian, low-byte
first) to the encoding names in order to explicitly specify a byte
order.

</p><p>In order to allow the automatic detection of the byte order, it has
become customary on some platforms (notably Win32) to start every
Unicode file with the character U+FEFF (ZERO WIDTH NO-BREAK SPACE),
also known as the Byte-Order Mark (BOM). Its byte-swapped equivalent
U+FFFE is not a valid Unicode character, therefore it helps to
unambiguously distinguish the Bigendian and Littleendian variants of
UTF-16 and UTF-32.

</p><p>A full featured character encoding converter will have to provide
the following 13 encoding variants of Unicode and UCS:

</p><blockquote>
<p>UCS-2, UCS-2BE, UCS-2LE, UCS-4, UCS-4LE, UCS-4BE, UTF-8, UTF-16,
UTF-16BE, UTF-16LE, UTF-32, UTF-32BE, UTF-32LE
</p></blockquote>

<p>Where no byte order is explicitly specified, use the byte order of
the CPU on which the conversion takes place and in an input stream
swap the byte order whenever U+FFFE is encountered. The difference
between outputting UCS-4 versus UTF-32 and UTF-16 versus UCS-2 lies in
handling out-of-range characters. The fallback mechanism for
non-representable characters has to be activated in UTF-32 (for
characters &gt; U-0010FFFF) or UCS-2 (for characters &gt; U+FFFF) even wher=
e
UCS-4 or UTF-16 respectively would offer a representation.

</p><p>Really just of historic interest are <a href=3D"http://www.itscj.ips=
j.or.jp/ISO-IR/178.pdf">UTF-1</a>, <a href=3D"http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc21=
52.txt">UTF-7</a>, <a href=3D"http://www.unicode.org/unicode/reports/tr6/">=
SCSU</a> and a
dozen other less widely publicised UCS encoding proposals with various
properties, none of which ever enjoyed any significant use. Their use
should be avoided.

</p><p>A good encoding converter will also offer options for adding or
removing the BOM:

</p><ul>

<li>Unconditionally prefix the output text with U+FEFF.

</li><li>Prefix the output text with U+FEFF unless it is already there.

</li><li>Remove the first character if it is U+FEFF.

</li></ul>

<p>It has also been suggested to use the UTF-8 encoded BOM (0xEF 0xBB
0xBF) as a signature to mark the beginning of a UTF-8 file. This
practice should definitely <strong>not</strong> be used on POSIX
systems for several reasons:

</p><ul>

<li>On POSIX systems, the locale (and not a magic file-type code)
defines the encoding of plain text files. Mixing the two concepts
would add a lot of complexity and break existing functionality.

</li><li>Adding a UTF-8 signature at the start of a file would interfere
with many established conventions such as the kernel looking for =E2=80=9C#=
!=E2=80=9D
at the beginning of a plaintext executable to locate the appropriate
interpreter.

</li><li>Handling BOMs properly would add undesirable complexity even to
simple programs like <samp>cat</samp> or <samp>grep</samp> that mix
contents of several files into one.

</li></ul>

<p>In addition to the encoding alternatives, Unicode also specifies
various <a href=3D"http://www.unicode.org/unicode/reports/tr15/">Normalizat=
ion
Forms</a>, which provide reasonable subsets of Unicode, especially to
remove encoding ambiguities caused by the presence of precomposed and
compatibility characters:

</p><ul>

<li><b>Normalization Form D (NFD):</b> Split up (decompose)
precomposed characters into combining sequences where possible,
e.g. use U+0041 U+0308 (LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A, COMBINING DIAERESIS)
instead of U+00C4 (LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A WITH DIAERESIS). Also avoid
deprecated characters, e.g. use U+0041 U+030A (LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A,
COMBINING RING ABOVE) instead of U+212B (ANGSTROM SIGN).

</li><li><b>Normalization Form C (NFC):</b> Use precomposed characters
instead of combining sequences where possible, e.g. use U+00C4 (=E2=80=9CLa=
tin
capital letter A with diaeresis=E2=80=9D) instead of U+0041 U+0308 (=E2=80=
=9CLatin
capital letter A=E2=80=9D, =E2=80=9Ccombining diaeresis=E2=80=9D). Also avo=
id deprecated
characters, e.g. use U+00C5 (LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A WITH RING ABOVE)
instead of U+212B (ANGSTROM SIGN).<br><em>NFC is the preferred form for
Linux and WWW.</em>

</li><li><b>Normalization Form KD (NFKD):</b> Like NFD, but avoid in
addition the use of compatibility characters, e.g. use =E2=80=9Cfi=E2=80=9D=
 instead of
U+FB01 (LATIN SMALL LIGATURE FI).

</li><li><b>Normalization Form KC (NFKC):</b> Like NFC, but avoid in
addition the use of compatibility characters, e.g. use =E2=80=9Cfi=E2=80=9D=
 instead of
U+FB01 (LATIN SMALL LIGATURE FI).

</li></ul>

<p>A full-featured character encoding converter should also offer
conversion between normalization forms. Care should be used with
mapping to NFKD or NFKC, as semantic information might be lost (for
instance U+00B2 (SUPERSCRIPT TWO) maps to 2) and extra mark-up
information might have to be added to preserve it (e.g.,
<samp>&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;</samp> in HTML).

</p><h2 id=3D"lang">What programming languages support Unicode?</h2>

<p>More recent programming languages that were developed after around
1993 already have special data types for Unicode/ISO 10646-1
characters. This is the case with Ada95, Java, TCL, Perl, Python, C#
and others.

</p><p>ISO C 90 specifies mechanisms to handle multi-byte encoding and
wide characters. These facilities were improved with <a href=3D"http://www.=
lysator.liu.se/c/na1.html">Amendment 1 to ISO C
90</a> in 1994 and even further improvements were made in the <a href=3D"ht=
tp://www.iso-9899.info/wiki/The_Standard#C99">ISO C 99</a> standard.
These facilities were designed originally with various East-Asian encodings
in mind. They are on one side slightly more sophisticated than what
would be necessary to handle UCS (handling of =E2=80=9Cshift sequences=E2=
=80=9D), but
also lack support for more advanced aspects of UCS (combining
characters, etc.). UTF-8 is an example of what the ISO C standard
calls multi-byte encoding. The type <var>wchar_t</var>, which in
modern environments is usually a signed 32-bit integer, can be used to
hold Unicode characters. (Since <var>wchar_t</var> has ended up being
a 16-bit type on some platforms and a 32-bit type on others,
<a href=3D"http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n1040.pdf">addit=
ional
types <var>char16_t</var> and <var>char32_t</var> have been proposed
in ISO TR 19769</a> for future revisions of the C language, to give
application programmers more control over the representation of such
wide strings.)

</p><p>Unfortunately, <var>wchar_t</var> was already widely used for
various Asian 16-bit encodings throughout the 1990s. Therefore, the
ISO C 99 standard was bound by backwards compatibility. It could not
be changed to require <var>wchar_t</var> to be used with UCS, like
Java and Ada95 managed to do. However, the C compiler can at least
signal to an application that <var>wchar_t</var> is guaranteed to hold
UCS values in all locales. To do so, it defines the macro
<samp>__STDC_ISO_10646__</samp> to be an integer constant of the form
<var>yyyymm</var>L. The year and month refer to the version of
ISO/IEC&nbsp;10646 and its amendments that have been implemented. For
example, <samp>__STDC_ISO_10646__ =3D=3D 200009L</samp> if the
implementation covers ISO/IEC 10646-1:2000.

</p><h2 id=3D"linux">How should Unicode be used under Linux?</h2>

<p>Before UTF-8 emerged, Linux users all over the world had to use
various different language-specific extensions of ASCII. Most popular
were ISO 8859-1 and ISO 8859-2 in Europe, ISO 8859-7 in Greece, KOI-8
/ ISO 8859-5 / CP1251 in Russia, EUC and Shift-JIS in Japan, <a href=3D"htt=
p://www.cns11643.gov.tw/web/big5/">BIG5</a> in Taiwan, etc.
This made the exchange of files difficult and application software had
to worry about various small differences between these encodings.
Support for these encodings was usually incomplete, untested, and
unsatisfactory, because the application developers rarely used all
these encodings themselves.

</p><p>Because of these difficulties, major Linux distributors and
application developers are now phasing out these older legacy
encodings in favour of UTF-8. UTF-8 support has improved dramatically
over the last few years and many people now use UTF-8 on a daily basis
in

</p><ul>
<li>text files (source code, HTML files, email messages, etc.)
</li><li>file names
</li><li>standard input and standard output, pipes
</li><li>environment variables
</li><li>cut and paste selection buffers
</li><li>telnet, modem, and serial port connections to terminal emulators
</li></ul>

<p>and in any other places where byte sequences used to be interpreted in
ASCII.

</p><p>In UTF-8 mode, terminal emulators such as xterm or the Linux
console driver transform every keystroke into the corresponding UTF-8
sequence and send it to the stdin of the foreground process.
Similarly, any output of a process on stdout is sent to the terminal
emulator, where it is processed with a UTF-8 decoder and then
displayed using a 16-bit font.

</p><p>Full Unicode functionality with all bells and whistles (e.g.
high-quality typesetting of the Arabic and Indic scripts) can only be
expected from sophisticated multi-lingual word-processing packages.
What Linux supports today on a broad base is far simpler and mainly
aimed at replacing the old 8- and 16-bit character sets. Linux
terminal emulators and command line tools usually only support a Level
1 implementation of ISO 10646-1 (no combining characters), and only
scripts such as Latin, Greek, Cyrillic, Armenian, Georgian, CJK, and
many scientific symbols are supported that need no further processing
support. At this level, UCS support is very comparable to ISO 8859
support and the only significant difference is that we have now
thousands of different characters available, that characters can be
represented by multibyte sequences, and that ideographic
Chinese/Japanese/Korean characters require two terminal character
positions (double-width).

</p><p>Level 2 support in the form of combining characters for selected
scripts (in particular <a href=3D"ftp://linux.thai.net/pub/thailinux/cvs/do=
cs/thaisupp/thaisupp.html">Thai</a>)
and Hangul Jamo is in parts also available (i.e., some fonts, terminal
emulators and editors support it via simple overstringing), but
precomposed characters should be preferred over combining character
sequences where available. More formally, the preferred way of
encoding text in Unicode under Linux should be <em>Normalization Form
C</em> as defined in <a href=3D"http://www.unicode.org/unicode/reports/tr15=
/">Unicode Technical
Report #15</a>.

</p><p>One influential non-POSIX PC operating system vendor (whom we shall
leave unnamed here) suggested that all Unicode files should start with
the character ZERO WIDTH NOBREAK SPACE (U+FEFF), which is in this role
also referred to as the =E2=80=9Csignature=E2=80=9D or =E2=80=9Cbyte-order =
mark (BOM)=E2=80=9D, in
order to identify the encoding and byte-order used in a file.
Linux/Unix does <strong>not</strong> use any BOMs and signatures. They
would break far too many existing ASCII syntax conventions (such as
scripts starting with <samp>#!</samp>). On POSIX systems, the selected
locale identifies already the encoding expected in all input and
output files of a process. (It has also been suggested to call UTF-8
files without a signature =E2=80=9CUTF-8N=E2=80=9D files, but this non-stan=
dard term
is usually not used in the POSIX world.)

</p><p>Before you switch to UTF-8 under Linux, update your installation to
a recent distribution with up-to-date UTF-8 support. This is
particular the case if you use an installation older than SuSE 9.1 or
Red Hat 8.0. Before these, UTF-8 support was not yet mature enough to
be recommendable for daily use.

</p><p><a href=3D"http://www.redhat.com/docs/manuals/linux/RHL-8.0-Manual/r=
elease-notes/x86/">Red
Hat Linux 8.0</a> (September 2002) was the first distribution to take
the leap of switching to UTF-8 as the default encoding for most
locales. The only exceptions were Chinese/Japanese/Korean locales, for
which there were at the time still too many specialized tools
available that did not yet support UTF-8. This first mass deployment
of UTF-8 under Linux caused most remaining issues to be ironed out
rather quickly during 2003. <a href=3D"http://www.novell.com/products/opens=
use/">SuSE
Linux</a> then switched its default locales to UTF-8 as well, as of
version <a href=3D"ftp://ftp.suse.com/pub/suse/i386/current/docu/RELEASE-NO=
TES.en.html">9.1</a>
(May 2004). It was followed by <a href=3D"http://www.ubuntulinux.org/">Ubun=
tu Linux</a>, the first
Debian-derivative that switched to UTF-8 as the system-wide default
encoding. With the migration of the three most popular Linux
distributions, UTF-8 related bugs have now been fixed in practically
all well-maintained Linux tools. Other distributions can be expected
to follow soon.

</p><h2 id=3D"mod">How do I have to modify my software?</h2>

<p>If you are a developer, there are several approaches to add UTF-8
support. We can split them into two categories, which I will call soft
and hard conversion. In soft conversion, data is kept in its UTF-8
form everywhere and only very few software changes are necessary. In
hard conversion, any UTF-8 data that the program reads will be
converted into wide-character arrays and will be handled as such
everywhere inside the application. Strings will only be converted back
to UTF-8 at output time. Internally, a character remains a fixed-size
memory object.

</p><p>We can also distinguish hard-wired and locale-dependent approaches
for supporting UTF-8, depending on how much the string processing
relies on the standard library. C offers a number of string processing
functions designed to handle arbitrary locale-specific multibyte
encodings. An application programmer who relies entirely on these can
remain unaware of the actual details of the UTF-8 encoding. Chances
are then that by merely changing the locale setting, several other
multi-byte encodings (such as EUC) will automatically be supported as
well. The other way a programmer can go is to hardcode knowledge about
UTF-8 into the application. This may lead in some situations to
significant performance improvements. It may be the best approach for
applications that will only be used with ASCII and UTF-8.

</p><p>Even where support for every multi-byte encoding supported by libc
is desired, it may well be worth adding extra code optimized for
UTF-8. Thanks to UTF-8=E2=80=99s self-synchronizing features, it can be
processed very efficiently. The locale-dependent libc string functions
can be two orders of magnitude slower than equivalent hardwired UTF-8
procedures. A bad teaching example was GNU grep 2.5.1, which relied
entirely on locale-dependent libc functions such as
<samp>mbrlen()</samp> for its generic multi-byte encoding support.
This made it about 100=C3=97 slower in multibyte mode than in
single-byte mode! Other applications with hardwired support for UTF-8
regular expressions (e.g., Perl 5.8) do not suffer this dramatic
slowdown.

</p><p>Most applications can do very fine with just soft conversion. This
is what makes the introduction of UTF-8 on Unix feasible at all. To
name two trivial examples, programs such as <samp>cat</samp> and
<samp>echo</samp> do not have to be modified at all. They can remain
completely ignorant as to whether their input and output is ISO 8859-2
or UTF-8, because they handle just byte streams without processing
them. They only recognize ASCII characters and control codes such as
<samp>'\n'</samp> which do not change in any way under UTF-8.
Therefore the UTF-8 encoding and decoding is done for these
applications completely in the terminal emulator.

</p><p>A small modification will be necessary for any program that
determines the number of characters in a string by counting the bytes.
With UTF-8, as with other multi-byte encodings, where the length of a
text string is of concern, programmers have to distinguish clearly
between

</p><ol>

<li>the number of bytes,

</li><li>the number of characters,

</li><li>the display width (e.g., the number of cursor position cells in a
VT100 terminal emulator)

</li></ol>

<p>of a string.

</p><p>C=E2=80=99s <samp>strlen(s)</samp> function always counts the <em>nu=
mber of
bytes</em>. This is the number relevant, for example, for memory
management (determination of string buffer sizes). Where the output of
strlen is used for such purposes, no change will be necessary.

</p><p>The <em>number of characters</em> can be counted in C in a portable
way using <samp>mbstowcs(NULL,s,0)</samp>. This works for UTF-8 like
for any other supported encoding, as long as the appropriate locale
has been selected. A hard-wired technique to count the number of
characters in a UTF-8 string is to count all bytes except those in the
range 0x80 =E2=80=93 0xBF, because these are just continuation bytes and no=
t
characters of their own. However, the need to count characters arises
surprisingly rarely in applications.

</p><p>In applications written for ASCII or ISO 8859, a far more common
use of <samp>strlen</samp> is to predict the <em>number of
columns</em> that the cursor of the terminal will advance if a string
is printed. With UTF-8, neither a byte nor a character count will
predict the display width, because ideographic characters (Chinese,
Japanese, Korean) will occupy two column positions, whereas control
and combining characters occupy none. To determine the width of a
string on the terminal screen, it is necessary to decode the UTF-8
sequence and then use the <samp>wcwidth</samp> function to test the
display width of each character, or <samp>wcswidth</samp> to measure
the entire string.

</p><p>For instance, the <samp>ls</samp> program had to be modified,
because without knowing the column widths of filenames, it cannot
format the table layout in which it presents directories to the user.
Similarly, all programs that assume somehow that the output is
presented in a fixed-width font and format it accordingly have to
learn how to count columns in UTF-8 text. Editor functions such as
deleting a single character have to be slightly modified to delete all
bytes that might belong to one character. Affected were for instance
editors (<samp>vi</samp>, <samp>emacs</samp>, <samp><a href=3D"http://cnsww=
w.cns.cwru.edu/~chet/readline/rltop.html">readline</a></samp>,
etc.) as well as programs that use the <samp>ncurses</samp> library.

</p><p>Any Unix-style kernel can do fine with soft conversion and needs
only very minor modifications to fully support UTF-8. Most kernel
functions that handle strings (e.g. file names, environment variables,
etc.) are not affected at all by the encoding. Modifications were
necessary in Linux the following places:

</p><ul>

<li>The console display and keyboard driver (another VT100 emulator)
have to encode and decode UTF-8 and should support at least some
subset of the Unicode character set. This had already been available
in Linux as early as kernel 1.2 (send ESC %G to the console to
activate UTF-8 mode).

</li><li>External file system drivers such as VFAT and WinNT have to
convert file name character encodings. UTF-8 is one of the available
conversion options, and the <samp>mount</samp> command has to tell the
kernel driver that user processes shall see UTF-8 file names. Since
VFAT and WinNT use already Unicode anyway, UTF-8 is the only available
encoding that guarantees a lossless conversion here.

</li><li>The tty driver of any POSIX system supports a =E2=80=9Ccooked=E2=
=80=9D mode, in
which some primitive line editing functionality is available. In order
to allow the character-erase function (which is activated when you
press backspace) to work properly with UTF-8, someone needs to tell it
not count continuation bytes in the range 0x80-0xBF as characters, but
to delete them as part of a UTF-8 multi-byte sequence. Since the
kernel is ignorant of the libc locale mechanics, another mechanism is
needed to tell the tty driver about UTF-8 being used. Linux kernel
versions 2.6 or newer support a bit IUTF8 in the c_iflag member
variable of struct termios. If it is set, the =E2=80=9Ccooked=E2=80=9D mode=
 line
editor will treat UTF-8 multi-byte sequences correctly. This mode can
be set from the command shell with =E2=80=9Cstty iutf8=E2=80=9D. Xterm and =
friends
should set this bit automatically when called in a UTF-8 locale.

</li></ul>

<h2 id=3D"c">C support for Unicode and UTF-8</h2>

<p>Starting with GNU glibc 2.2, the type <samp>wchar_t</samp> is
officially intended to be used only for 32-bit ISO 10646 values,
independent of the currently used locale. This is signalled to
applications by the definition of the <samp>__STDC_ISO_10646__</samp>
macro as required by ISO C99. The ISO C multi-byte conversion
functions (<samp>mbsrtowcs()</samp>, <samp>wcsrtombs()</samp>, etc.)
are fully implemented in glibc 2.2 or higher and can be used to
convert between <samp>wchar_t</samp> and any locale-dependent
multibyte encoding, including UTF-8, ISO 8859-1, etc.

</p><p>For example, you can write

</p><pre>  #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
  #include &lt;locale.h&gt;

  int main()
  {
    if (!setlocale(LC_CTYPE, "")) {
      fprintf(stderr, "Can't set the specified locale! "
              "Check LANG, LC_CTYPE, LC_ALL.\n");
      return 1;
    }
    printf("%ls\n", L"Sch=C3=B6ne Gr=C3=BC=C3=9Fe");
    return 0;
  }
</pre>

<p>Call this program with the locale setting <samp>LANG=3Dde_DE</samp>
and the output will be in ISO 8859-1. Call it with
<samp>LANG=3Dde_DE.UTF-8</samp> and the output will be in UTF-8. The
<samp>%ls</samp> format specifier in <samp>printf</samp> calls
<samp>wcsrtombs</samp> in order to convert the wide character argument
string into the locale-dependent multi-byte encoding.

</p><p>Many of C=E2=80=99s string functions are locale-independent and they=
 just
look at zero-terminated byte sequences:

</p><pre>  strcpy strncpy strcat strncat strcmp strncmp strdup strchr strrc=
hr
  strcspn strspn strpbrk strstr strtok
</pre>

<p>Some of these (e.g. strcpy) can equally be used for single-byte
(ISO 8859-1) and multi-byte (UTF-8) encoded character sets, as they
need no notion of how many byte long a character is, while others
(e.g., strchr) depend on one character being encoded in a single char
value and are of less use for UTF-8 (strchr still works fine if you
just search for an ASCII character in a UTF-8 string).

</p><p>Other C functions are locale dependent and work in UTF-8 locales
just as well:

</p><pre>  strcoll strxfrm
</pre>

<h2 id=3D"activate">How should the UTF-8 mode be activated?</h2>

<p>If your application is soft converted and does not use the standard
locale-dependent C multibyte routines (<samp>mbsrtowcs()</samp>,
<samp>wcsrtombs()</samp>, etc.) to convert everything into
<samp>wchar_t</samp> for processing, then it might have to find out in
some way, whether it is supposed to assume that the text data it
handles is in some 8-bit encoding (like ISO 8859-1, where 1 byte =3D 1
character) or UTF-8. Once everyone uses only UTF-8, you can just make
it the default, but until then both the classical 8-bit sets and UTF-8
may still have to be supported.

</p><p>The first wave of applications with UTF-8 support used a whole lot
of different command line switches to activate their respective UTF-8
modes, for instance the famous <samp>xterm -u8</samp>. That turned out
to be a very bad idea. Having to remember a special command line
option or other configuration mechanism for <em>every</em> application
is very tedious, which is why command line options are
<strong>not</strong> the proper way of activating a UTF-8 mode.

</p><p>The proper way to activate UTF-8 is the POSIX locale mechanism. A
locale is a configuration setting that contains information about
culture-specific conventions of software behaviour, including the
character encoding, the date/time notation, alphabetic sorting rules,
the measurement system and common office paper size, etc. The names of
locales usually consist of <a href=3D"http://lcweb.loc.gov/standards/iso639=
-2/iso639jac.html">ISO
639-1</a> language and <a href=3D"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_=
alpha-2">ISO
3166-1 alpha-2</a> country codes, sometimes with additional encoding names =
or
other qualifiers.

</p><p>You can get a list of all locales installed on your system (usually
in <samp>/usr/lib/locale/</samp>) with the command <samp>locale
-a</samp>. Set the environment variable <samp>LANG</samp> to the name
of your preferred locale. When a C program executes the
<samp>setlocale(LC_CTYPE, "")</samp> function, the library will test
the environment variables <samp>LC_ALL</samp>, <samp>LC_CTYPE</samp>,
and <samp>LANG</samp> in that order, and the first one of these that
has a value will determine which locale data is loaded for the
<samp>LC_CTYPE</samp> category (which controls the multibyte
conversion functions). The locale data is split up into separate
categories. For example, <samp>LC_CTYPE</samp> defines the character
encoding and <samp>LC_COLLATE</samp> defines the string sorting order.
The <samp>LANG</samp> environment variable is used to set the default
locale for all categories, but the <samp>LC_*</samp> variables can be
used to override individual categories. Do not worry too much about the
country identifiers in the locales. Locales such as <samp>en_GB</samp>
(English in Great Britain) and <samp>en_AU</samp> (English in
Australia) differ usually only in the <samp>LC_MONETARY</samp>
category (name of currency, rules for printing monetary amounts),
which practically no Linux application ever uses.
<samp>LC_CTYPE=3Den_GB</samp> and <samp>LC_CTYPE=3Den_AU</samp> have
exactly the same effect.

</p><p id=3D"collate" class=3D"note"><b>Effect of locale on sorting order:<=
/b> If
 you had not set a locale previously, you may quickly notice that
 setting one (e.g., LANG=3Den_US.UTF-8 or LANG=3Den_GB.UTF-8), also
 changes the sorting order used by some tools: the =E2=80=9Cls=E2=80=9D com=
mand now
 sorts filenames with uppercase and lowercase first character next to
 each other (like in a dictionary), and file globbing no longer uses
 the ASCII order either (e.g. =E2=80=9Cecho [a-z]*=E2=80=9D also lists file=
names
 starting uppercase). To get the old ASCII sorting order back that you
 are used to, simply set in addition also LC_COLLATE=3DPOSIX (or
 equivalently LC_COLLATE=3DC), and you will quickly feel at home again.

</p><p>You can query the name of the character encoding in your current
locale with the command <samp>locale charmap</samp>. This should say
<samp>UTF-8</samp> if you successfully picked a UTF-8 locale in the
LC_CTYPE category. The command <samp>locale -m</samp> provides a list
with the names of all installed character encodings.

</p><p>If you use exclusively C library multibyte functions to do all the
conversion between the external character encoding and the
<samp>wchar_t</samp> encoding that you use internally, then the C
library will take care of using the right encoding according to
<samp>LC_CTYPE</samp> for you and your program does not even have to
know explicitly what the current multibyte encoding is.

</p><p>However, if you prefer not to do everything using the libc
multi-byte functions (e.g., because you think this would require too
many changes in your software or is not efficient enough), then your
application has to find out for itself when to activate the UTF-8
mode. To do this, on any X/Open compliant systems, where <a href=3D"http://=
www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/007904975/basedefs/langinfo.h.html"><samp>&lt;=
langinfo.h&gt;</samp></a> is available, you can use a line
such as

</p><pre>  utf8_mode =3D (strcmp(nl_langinfo(CODESET), "UTF-8") =3D=3D 0);<=
/pre>

<p>in order to detect whether the current locale uses the UTF-8
encoding. You have of course to add a <samp>setlocale(LC_CTYPE,
"")</samp> at the beginning of your application to set the locale
according to the environment variables first. The standard function
call <samp>nl_langinfo(CODESET)</samp> is also what <samp>locale
charmap</samp> calls to find the name of the encoding specified by the
current locale for you. It is available on pretty much every modern
Unix now. FreeBSD added <samp>nl_langinfo(CODESET)</samp> support with
version 4.6 (2002-06). If you need an autoconf test for the
availability of <samp>nl_langinfo(CODESET)</samp>, here is the one

<p>[You could also try to query the locale environment variables

for the first of these environment variables that has a value. Make
the UTF-8 mode the default (still overridable by command line

as this indicates reasonably reliably that the C library has been
asked to use a UTF-8 locale. An example code fragment that does this
is

</p><pre>  char *s;
  int utf8_mode =3D 0;

  if (((s =3D getenv("LC_ALL"))   &amp;&amp; *s) ||

<p>Some simple support for nonspacing or enclosing combining
characters (i.e., those with <a href=3D"ftp://ftp.unicode.org/Public/UNIDAT=
A/UnicodeData.html#GeneralCategory">general category code</a> Mn or Me in t=
he <a href=3D"ftp://ftp.unicode.org/Public/UNIDATA/UnicodeData.txt">Unicode
database</a>) is now also available, which is implemented by just
overstriking (logical OR-ing) a base-character glyph with up to two
combining-character glyphs. This produces acceptable results for
accents below the base line and accents on top of small characters. It
also works well, for example, for Thai and Korean Hangul Conjoining Jamo
fonts that were specifically designed for use with overstriking.

</p><p><b>A note for programmers of text mode applications:</b>

</p><p>With support for CJK ideographs and combining characters, the
output of xterm behaves a little bit more like with a proportional
font, because a Latin/Greek/Cyrillic/etc. character requires one
column position, a CJK ideograph two, and a combining character zero.

</p><p>The Open Group=E2=80=99s <a href=3D"http://www.unix-systems.org/onli=
ne.html">Single UNIX
Specification</a> specifies the two C functions <a href=3D"http://www.cl.ca=
m.ac.uk/~mgk25/ucs/wcwidth.html">wcwidth()</a> and <a href=3D"http://www.cl=
.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/ucs/wcswidth.html">wcswidth()</a> that allow an applicati=
on to
test how many column positions a character will occupy:

</p><pre>  #include &lt;wchar.h&gt;
  int wcwidth(wchar_t wc);
  int wcswidth(const wchar_t *pwcs, size_t n);
</pre>

<p><a href=3D"http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/ucs/wcwidth.c">Markus Kuhn=E2=
=80=99s free wcwidth()
implementation</a> can be used by applications on platforms where the C
library does not yet provide a suitable function.

</p><p>Xterm will for the foreseeable future probably not support the
following functionality, which you might expect from a more
sophisticated full Unicode rendering engine:

</p><ul>

<li>bidirectional output of Hebrew and Arabic characters
</li><li>substitution of
<a href=3D"http://www.unicode.org/unicode/uni2book/ch08.pdf">Arabic</a>
presentation forms
</li><li>substitution of
<a href=3D"http://www.unicode.org/unicode/uni2book/ch09.pdf">Indic</a>/Syri=
ac
ligatures
</li><li>arbitrary stacks of combining characters

</li></ul>

<p>Hebrew and Arabic users will therefore have to use application
programs that reverse and left-pad Hebrew and Arabic strings before
sending them to the terminal. In other words, the bidirectional
processing has to be done by the application and not by xterm. The
situation for Hebrew and Arabic improves over ISO 8859 at least in the
form of the availability of precomposed glyphs and presentation forms.
It is far from clear at the moment, whether bidirectional support
should really go into xterm and how precisely this should work. Both
<a href=3D"http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-04=
8.htm">ISO
6429 =3D ECMA-48</a> and the <a href=3D"http://www.unicode.org/unicode/repo=
rts/tr9/">Unicode bidi
algorithm</a> provide alternative starting points. See also <a href=3D"http=
://www.ecma-international.org/publications/techreports/E-TR-053.htm">ECMA
Technical Report TR/53</a>.

</p><p>If you plan to support bidirectional text output in your
application, have a look at either Dov Grobgeld=E2=80=99s <a href=3D"http:/=
/fribidi.sourceforge.net/">FriBidi</a> or Mark Leisher=E2=80=99s <a href=3D=
"http://crl.nmsu.edu/~mleisher/ucdata.html">Pretty Good Bidi
Algorithm</a>, two free implementations of the Unicode bidi algorithm.

</p><p>Xterm currently does not support the Arabic, Syriac, or Indic text
formatting algorithms, although Robert Brady has published some <a href=3D"=
http://www.zepler.org/~rwb197/xterm/">experimental patches</a>
towards bidi support. It is still unclear whether it is feasible or
preferable to do this in a VT100 emulator at all. Applications can
apply the Arabic and Hangul formatting algorithms themselves easily,
because xterm allows them to output the necessary presentation forms.
For Hangul, Unicode contains the presentation forms needed for modern
(post-1933) Korean orthography. For Indic scripts, the X font
mechanism at the moment does not even support the encoding of the
necessary ligature variants, so there is little xterm could offer
anyway. Applications requiring Indic or Syriac output should better
use a proper Unicode X11 rendering library such as <a href=3D"http://www.pa=
ngo.org/">Pango</a> instead of a VT100 emulator like
xterm.

</p><h2 id=3D"fonts">Where do I find ISO 10646-1 X11 fonts?</h2>

<p>Quite a number of Unicode fonts have become available for X11 over
the past few months, and the list is growing quickly:

</p><ul>

<li>Markus Kuhn together with a number of other volunteers has
extended the old <samp>-misc-fixed-*-iso8859-1</samp> fonts that come
with X11 towards a repertoire that covers all European characters
(Latin, Greek, Cyrillic, intl. phonetic alphabet, mathematical and
technical symbols, in some fonts even Armenian, Georgian, Katakana,
Thai, and more). For more information see the <a href=3D"http://www.cl.cam.=

10646-1 versions of all the Adobe and B&amp;H BDF fonts in the X11R6.4
distribution</a>. These fonts already contained the full PostScript
font repertoire (around 30 additional characters, mostly those used
also by CP1252 MS-Windows, e.g. smart quotes, dashes, etc.), which
were however not available under the ISO 8859-1 encoding. They are now
all accessible in the ISO 10646-1 version, along with many additional
precomposed characters covering ISO 8859-1,2,3,4,9,10,13,14,15. These

</li><li>Some future XFree86 release might also remove most old BDF fonts
from the distribution and replace them with ISO 10646-1 encoded
versions. The X server will be extended with an automatic encoding
converter that creates other font encodings such as ISO 8859-* from
the ISO 10646-1 font file on-the-fly when such a font is requested by
old 8-bit software. Modern software should preferably use the ISO

whatever font they select covers the subset of characters needed by
them.

</p><p>The <samp>*-ISO10646-1</samp> fonts usually also specify a
<samp>DEFAULT_CHAR</samp> value that points to a special non-Unicode
glyph for representing any character that is not available in the font

ensures that users at least see clearly that there is an unsupported
character. The smaller fixed-width fonts such as 6x13 etc. for xterm
will never be able to cover all of Unicode, because many scripts such
as Kanji can only be represented in considerably larger pixel sizes
than those widely used by European users. Typical Unicode fonts for
European usage will contain only subsets of between 1000 and 3000

</p><h2 id=3D"term">What are the issues related to UTF-8 terminal emulators=
?</h2>

<p><a href=3D"http://vt100.net/">VT100</a> terminal emulators accept ISO
2022 (=3D<a href=3D"http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standard=
s/Ecma-035.htm">ECMA-35</a>)
ESC sequences in order to switch between different character sets.

</p><p>UTF-8 is in the sense of ISO 2022 an =E2=80=9Cother coding system=E2=
=80=9D (see
section 15.4 of ECMA 35). UTF-8 is outside the ISO 2022
SS2/SS3/G0/G1/G2/G3 world, so if you switch from ISO 2022 to UTF-8,
all SS2/SS3/G0/G1/G2/G3 states become meaningless until you leave
UTF-8 and switch back to ISO 2022. UTF-8 is a stateless encoding, i.e.
a self-terminating short byte sequence determines completely which
character is meant, independent of any switching state. G0 and G1 in
ISO 10646-1 are those of ISO 8859-1, and G2/G3 do not exist in ISO
10646, because every character has a fixed position and no switching
takes place. With UTF-8, it is not possible that your terminal remains
switched to strange graphics-character mode after you accidentally
dumped a binary file to it. This makes a terminal in UTF-8 mode much
more robust than with ISO 2022 and it is therefore useful to have a
way of locking a terminal into UTF-8 mode such that it cannot
accidentally go back to the ISO 2022 world.

</p><p>The ISO 2022 standard specifies a range of ESC % sequences for
leaving the ISO 2022 world (designation of other coding system, DOCS),
and a number of such sequences have been registered for <a href=3D"http://w=
ww.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/ucs/ISO-10646-UTF-8.html">UTF-8</a> in section 2.8 o=
f the <a href=3D"http://www.itscj.ipsj.or.jp/ISO-IR/">ISO 2375 Internationa=
l
Register of Coded Character Sets</a>:

</p><ul>

<li><samp>ESC %G</samp> activates UTF-8 with an unspecified
implementation level from ISO 2022 in a way that allows to go back
to ISO 2022 again.

</li><li><samp>ESC %@</samp> goes back from UTF-8 to ISO 2022 in case
UTF-8 had been entered via <samp>ESC %G</samp>.

</li><li><samp>ESC %/G</samp> switches to UTF-8 Level 1 with no return.
</li><li><samp>ESC %/H</samp> switches to UTF-8 Level 2 with no return.
</li><li><samp>ESC %/I</samp> switches to UTF-8 Level 3 with no return.

</li></ul>

<p>While a terminal emulator is in UTF-8 mode, any ISO 2022 escape
sequences such as for switching G2/G3 etc. are ignored. The only ISO
2022 sequence on which a terminal emulator might act in UTF-8 mode is
<samp>ESC %@</samp> for returning from UTF-8 back to the ISO 2022
scheme.

</p><p>UTF-8 still allows you to use C1 control characters such as CSI,
even though UTF-8 also uses bytes in the range 0x80-0x9F. It is
important to understand that a terminal emulator in UTF-8 mode must
apply the UTF-8 decoder to the incoming byte stream
<strong>before</strong> interpreting any control characters. C1
characters are UTF-8 decoded just like any other character above
U+007F.

</p><p>Many text-mode applications available today expect to speak to the
terminal using a legacy encoding or to use ISO 2022 sequences for
switching terminal fonts. In order to use such applications within a
UTF-8 terminal emulator, it is possible to use a conversion layer that
will translate between ISO 2022 and UTF-8 on the fly. Examples for
such utilities are Juliusz Chroboczek=E2=80=99s <a href=3D"http://invisible=
-island.net/luit/">luit</a> and <a href=3D"http://www.pps.jussieu.fr/~jch/s=
oftware/pluto/">pluto</a>. If
all you need is ISO 8859 support in a UTF-8 terminal, you can also use
<a href=3D"ftp://ftp.uni-erlangen.de/pub/utilities/screen/">screen</a>
(version 4.0 or newer) by Michael Schr=C3=B6der and J=C3=BCrgen Weigert. As
implementation of ISO 2022 is a complex and error-prone task, better
avoid implementing ISO 2022 yourself. Implement only UTF-8 and point
users who need ISO 2022 at luit (or screen).

<h2 id=3D"solaris">How does UTF-8 support work under Solaris?</h2>

<p>Starting with Solaris 2.8, UTF-8 is at least partially supported.
To use it, just set one of the UTF-8 locales, for instance by typing

</p><pre> setenv LANG en_US.UTF-8
</pre>

<p>in a C shell.

</p><p>Now the <samp>dtterm</samp> terminal emulator can be used to input
and output UTF-8 text and the <samp>mp</samp> print filter will print
UTF-8 files on PostScript printers. The <samp>en_US.UTF-8</samp>
locale is at the moment supported by Motif and CDE desktop
applications and libraries, but not by OpenWindows, XView, and
OPENLOOK DeskSet applications and libraries.

</p><p>For more information, read Sun=E2=80=99s <a href=3D"http://docs.sun.=

e Support</a> web page.

</p><h2 id=3D"web">Can I use UTF-8 on the Web?</h2>

<p>Yes. There are two ways in which a HTTP server can indicate to a
client that a document is encoded in UTF-8:

</p><ul>

<li>Make sure that the HTTP header of a document contains the
line
<pre>  Content-Type: text/html; charset=3Dutf-8
</pre>
if the file is HTML, or the line
<pre>  Content-Type: text/plain; charset=3Dutf-8
</pre>
if the file is plain text. How this can be achieved depends on your
web server. If you use <a href=3D"http://httpd.apache.org/">Apache</a>
and you have a subdirecory in which all *.html or *.txt files are
encoded in UTF-8, then create there a file <a href=3D"http://httpd.apache.o=
rg/docs/configuring.html#htaccess">.htaccess</a> and add to it the two line=
s

<pre>  AddType text/html;charset=3DUTF-8 html
  AddType text/plain;charset=3DUTF-8 txt
</pre>

A webmaster can modify /etc/httpd/mime.types to make the same change
for all subdirectories simultaneously.

</li><li>If you cannot influence the HTTP headers that the web server
prefixes to your documents automatically, then add in a HTML document
under HEAD the element

<pre>  &lt;META http-equiv=3DContent-Type content=3D"text/html; charset=3DU=
TF-8"&gt;
</pre>

which usually has the same effect. This obviously works only for HTML
files, not for plain text. It also announces the encoding of the file
to the parser only after the parser has already started to read the
file, so it is clearly the less elegant approach.

</li></ul>

<p>The currently most widely used browsers support UTF-8 well enough
to generally recommend UTF-8 for use on web pages. The old Netscape 4
browser used an annoyingly large single font for displaying any UTF-8
document. Best upgrade to Mozilla, Netscape 6 or some other recent
browser (Netscape 4 is generally very buggy and not maintained any
more).

</p><p>There is also the question of how non-ASCII characters entered into
HTML forms are encoded in the subsequent HTTP GET or POST request that
transfers the field contents to a CGI script on the server.
Unfortunately, both <a href=3D"http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/interact/for=
ms.html#h-17.13">standardization</a> and implementation are still a huge me=
ss here, as
discussed in the <a href=3D"http://ppewww.ph.gla.ac.uk/~flavell/charset/for=
m-i18n.html">
FORM submission and i18n tutorial</a> by Alan Flavell. We can only
hope that a practice of doing all this in UTF-8 will emerge
eventually. See also the discussion about <a href=3D"http://bugzilla.mozill=

</p><h2 id=3D"ps">How are PostScript glyph names related to UCS codes?</h2>

<p>See Adobe=E2=80=99s <a href=3D"http://www.adobe.com/devnet/opentype/arch=
ives/glyph.html">Unicode
and Glyph Names</a> guide.

</p><h2 id=3D"subsets">Are there any well-defined UCS subsets?</h2>

<p>With over 40000 characters, the design of a font that covers every
single Unicode character is an enormous project, not just regarding
the number of glyphs that need to be created, but also in terms of the
calligraphic expertise required to do an adequate job for each script.
As a result, there are hardly any fonts that try to cover =E2=80=9Call of
Unicode=E2=80=9D. While a few projects have attempted to create single
complete Unicode fonts, their quality is not comparable with that of
many good smaller fonts. For example, the Unicode and ISO 10646 books
are still printed using a large collection of different fonts that
only together cover the entire repertoire. Any high-quality font can
only cover the Unicode subset for which the designer feels competent
and confident.

</p><p>Older, regional character encoding standards defined both an encodin=
g
and a repertoire of characters that an individual calligrapher could
handle. Unicode lacks the latter, but in the interest of
interoperability, it is useful to have defined a hand full of
standardized subsets, each a few hundred to a few thousand character
large and targeted at particular markets, that font designers could
practically aim to cover. A number of different UCS subsets already
have been established:

</p><ul>

<li>The <a href=3D"http://partners.adobe.com/asn/tech/type/opentype/appendi=
ces/wgl4.jsp">Windows
Glyph List 4.0 (WGL4)</a> is a set of 650 characters that covers all
the 8-bit MS-DOS, Windows, Mac, and ISO code pages that Microsoft had
used before. All Windows fonts now cover at least the WGL4 repertoire.
WGL4 is a superset of CEN MES-1. (<a href=3D"http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25=
/ucs/wgl4.txt">WGL4 test
file</a>).

</li><li>Three <a href=3D"http://www.evertype.com/standards/iso10646/pdf/cw=
a13873.pdf">European
UCS subsets MES-1, MES-2, and MES-3</a> have been defined by the
European standards committee CEN/TC304 in CWA 13873:

<ul>

<li>MES-1 is a very small Latin subset with only 335 characters. It
contains exactly all characters found in ISO 6937 plus the EURO SIGN.
This means MES-1 contains all characters of ISO 8859 parts
1,2,3,4,9,10,15. [Note: If your aim is to provide only the cheapest
and simplest reasonable Central European UCS subset, I would implement
MES-1 plus the following important 14 additional characters found in
Windows code page 1252 but not in MES-1: U+0192, U+02C6, U+02DC,
U+2013, U+2014, U+201A, U+201E, U+2020, U+2021, U+2022, U+2026,
U+2030, U+2039, U+203A.]

</li><li>MES-2 is a Latin/Greek/Cyrillic/Armenian/Georgian subset with 1052
characters. It covers every language and every 8-bit code page used in
Europe (not just the EU!) and European language countries. It also
adds a small collection of mathematical symbols for use in technical
documentation. MES-2 is a superset of MES-1. If you are developing
only for a European or Western market, MES-2 is the recommended
repertoire. [Note: For bizarre committee-politics reasons, the
following eight WGL4 characters are missing from MES-2: U+2113,
U+212E, U+2215, U+25A1, U+25AA, U+25AB, U+25CF, U+25E6. If you
implement MES-2, you should definitely also add those and then you can
claim WGL4 conformance in addition.]

</li><li>MES-3 is a very comprehensive UCS subset with 2819 characters. It
simply includes every UCS collection that seemed of potential use to
European users. This is for the more ambitious implementors. MES-3 is
a superset of MES-2 and WGL4.

</li></ul>

</li><li>JIS X 0221-1995 specifies 7 non-overlapping UCS subsets for
Japanese users:

<ul>

<li>Basic Japanese (6884 characters): JIS X 0208-1997, JIS X 0201-1997

</li><li>Japanese Non-ideographic Supplement (1913 characters): JIS X
0212-1990 non-kanji, plus various other non-kanji

</li><li>Japanese Ideographic Supplement 1 (918 characters): some JIS X

</li><li>Japanese Ideographic Supplement 3 (8745 characters): remaining
Chinese characters

</li><li>Full-width Alphanumeric (94 characters): for compatibility

</li><li>Half-width Katakana (63 characters): for compatibility

</li></ul>

<a href=3D"http://www.evertype.com/standards/iso10646/ucs-collections.html"=

</p><h2 id=3D"conv">What issues are there to consider when converting encod=
ings</h2>

<p>The Unicode Consortium maintains a <a href=3D"http://www.unicode.org/Pub=
lic/MAPPINGS/">collection of mapping
tables</a> between Unicode and various older encoding standards. It is
important to understand that the primary purpose of these tables was
to demonstrate that Unicode is a superset of the mapped legacy
encodings, and to document the motivation and origin behind those
Unicode characters that were included into the standard primarily for
round-trip compatibility reasons with older character sets. The
implementation of good character encoding conversion rountines is a
significantly more complex task than just blindly applying these
example mapping tables! This is because some character sets
distinguish characters that others unify.

</p><p>The Unicode mapping tables alone are to some degree well suited to
directly convert text from the older encodings to Unicode. High-end
conversion tools nevertheless should provide interactive mechanisms,
where characters that are unified in the legacy encoding but
distinguished in Unicode can interactively or semi-automatically be
disambiguated on a case-by-case basis.

</p><p>Conversion in the opposite direction from Unicode to a legacy
character set requires non-injective (=3D many-to-one) extensions of
these mapping tables. Several Unicode characters have to be mapped to
a single code point in many legacy encodings. The Unicode consortium
currently does not maintain standard many-to-one tables for this
purpose and does not define any standard behavior of coded character
set conversion tools.

</p><p>Here are some examples for the many-to-one mappings that have to be
handled when converting from Unicode into something else:

</p><p></p><table class=3D"solid">

<p>A first approximation of such many-to-one tables can be generated
from available normalization information, but these then still have to
be manually extended and revised. For example, it seems obvious that
the character 0xE1 in the original IBM PC character set was meant to
be useable as both a Greek small beta (because it is located between
the code positions for alpha and gamma) and as a German sharp-s
character (because that code is produced when pressing this letter on
a German keyboard). Similarly 0xEE can be either the mathematical
element-of sign, as well as a small epsilon. These characters are not
Unicode normalization equivalents, because although they look similar
in low-resolution video fonts, they are very different characters in
high-quality typography. <a href=3D"http://www.unicode.org/Public/MAPPINGS/=
VENDORS/IBM/">IBM=E2=80=99s
tables</a> for CP437 reflected one usage in some cases, Microsoft=E2=80=99s
the other, both equally sensible. A good code converter should aim to
be compatible with both, and not just blindly use the <a href=3D"http://www=
.unicode.org/Public/MAPPINGS/VENDORS/MICSFT/PC/CP437.TXT">Microsoft
mapping table</a> alone when converting from Unicode.

</p><p>The <a href=3D"http://www.unicode.org/Public/UNIDATA/UnicodeData.htm=
l">Unicode
database</a> does contain in field 5 the Character Decomposition
Mapping that can be used to generate some of the above example
mappings automatically. As a rule, the output of a
Unicode-to-Something converter should not depend on whether the
Unicode input has first been converted into <a href=3D"http://www.unicode.o=
rg/unicode/reports/tr15/">Normalization Form
C</a> or not. For equivalence information on Chinese, Japanese, and
Korean Han/Kanji/Hanja characters, use the <a href=3D"http://www.unicode.or=
g/charts/unihan.html">Unihan database</a>.
In the cases of the IBM PC characters in the above examples, where the
normalization tables do not offer adequate mapping, the
cross-references to similar looking characters in the Unicode book are
a valuable source of suggestions for equivalence mappings. In the end,
which mappings are used and which not is a matter of taste and
observed usage.

</p><p data-find=3D"_1">The Unicode consortium used to maintain mapping tab=
les to CJK
character set standards, but has declared them to be obsolete, because
their presence on the Unicode web server led to the development of a
number of inadequate and naive EUC converters. In particular, the (now
obsolete) CJK Unicode mapping tables had to be slightly modified
sometimes to preserve information in combination encodings. For
example, the standard mappings provide round-trip compatibility for
conversion chains ASCII to Unicode to ASCII as well as for JIS X 0208
to Unicode to JIS X 0208. However, the EUC-JP encoding covers the
union of ASCII and JIS X 0208, and the UCS repertoire covered by the
ASCII and JIS X 0208 mapping tables overlaps for one character, namely
U+005C REVERSE SOLIDUS. EUC-JP converters therefore have to use a
slightly modified JIS X 0208 mapping table, such that the JIS X 0208
code 0x2140 (0xA1 0xC0 in EUC-JP) gets mapped to U+FF3C FULLWIDTH
REVERSE SOLIDUS. This way, round-trip compatibility from EUC-JP to
Unicode to EUC-JP can be guaranteed without any loss of information.
<a href=3D"http://www.unicode.org/unicode/reports/tr11/#Recommendation">Uni=
code
Standard Annex #11: East Asian Width</a> provides further guidance on
this issue. Another problem area is compatibility with older
conversion tables, as explained in an <a href=3D"http://www.debian.or.jp/~k=
ubota/unicode-symbols.html">essay by
Tomohiro Kubota</a>.

</p><p>In addition to just using standard normalization mappings,
developers of code converters can also offer transliteration support.
Transliteration is the conversion of a Unicode character into a
graphically and/or semantically similar character in the target code,
even if the two are distinct characters in Unicode after
normalization. Examples of transliteration:

</p><p></p><table class=3D"solid">

<p>The Unicode Consortium does not provide or maintain any standard
transliteration tables at this time. CEN/TC304 has a draft report
=E2=80=9CEuropean fallback rules=E2=80=9D on recommended ASCII fallback cha=

</p><h2 id=3D"x11">Is X11 ready for Unicode?</h2>

<p>The <a href=3D"ftp://ftp.x.org/pub/X11R7.0/">X11 R7.0 release</a>
(2005) is the latest version of the X Consortium=E2=80=99s sample
implementation of the X11 Window System standards. The bulk of the <a href=
=3D"ftp://ftp.x.org/pub/X11R7.0/doc/PDF/">current X11 standards</a>
and parts of the sample implementation still pre-date widespread
interest in Unicode under Unix.

</p><p>Among the things that have already been fixed are:

</p><ul>

<li><b>Keysyms:</b> Since X11R6.9, a keysym value has been allocated
for every Unicode character in Appendix A of the <a href=3D"ftp://ftp.x.org=
/pub/X11R7.0/doc/PDF/proto.pdf">X Window System
Protocol</a> specification. Any UCS character in the range U-00000100
to U-00FFFFFF can now be represented by a keysym value in the range
0x01000100 to 0x01ffffff. This scheme was proposed by Markus Kuhn in
1998 and has been supported by a number of applications for many
years, starting with xterm. The revised Appendix A now also contains
an official UCS cross reference column in its table of pre-Unicode
legacy keysyms.

</li><li><b>UTF-8 locales:</b> The X11R6.8 sample implementation added
support for UTF-8 locales.

</li><li><b>Fonts:</b> A number of comprehensive Unicode standard fonts
were added in X11R6.8, and they are now supported by some of the
classic standard tools, such as xterm.

</li></ul>

<p>There remain a number of problems in the X11 standards and some
inconveniences in the sample implementation for Unicode users that
still need to be fixed in one of the next X11 releases:

</p><ul>

<li><p><b>UTF-8 cut and paste:</b> The <a href=3D"ftp://ftp.x.org/pub/X11R7=
.0/doc/PDF/icccm.pdf">ICCCM</a>
standard still does not specify how to transfer UCS strings in
selections. Some vendors have added UTF-8 as yet another encoding to
the existing <a href=3D"ftp://ftp.x.org/pub/X11R7.0/doc/PDF/ctext.pdf">COMP=
OUND_TEXT</a> mechanism (CTEXT). This is not a good solution for
at least the following reasons:</p>

<ul>

<li>CTEXT is a rather complicated ISO 2022 mechanism and Unicode
offers the opportunity to provide not just another add-on to CTEXT,
but to replace the entire monster with something far simpler, more
convenient, and equally powerful.

</li><li>Many existing applications can communicate selections via CTEXT,
but do not support a newly added UTF-8 option. A user of CTEXT has to
decide whether to use the old ISO 2022 encodings or the new UTF-8
encoding, but both cannot be offered simultaneously. In other words,
adding UTF-8 to CTEXT seriously breaks backwards compatibility with
existing CTEXT applications.

</li><li>The current CTEXT specification even explicitly forbids the
addition of UTF-8 in section 6: =E2=80=9CISO registered =E2=80=98other codi=
ng systems=E2=80=99
are not used in Compound Text; extended segments are the only
mechanism for non-2022 encodings.=E2=80=9D

</li></ul>

<p><a href=3D"http://www.dcs.ed.ac.uk/home/jec/">Juliusz Chroboczek</a>
has written an <a href=3D"http://www.pps.jussieu.fr/~jch/software/UTF8_STRI=
NG/">Inter-Client Exchange of Unicode Text</a> draft proposal for an
extension of the ICCCM to handle UTF-8 selections with a new
UTF8_STRING atom that can be used as a property type and selection
target. This clean approach fixes all of the above problems.
UTF8_STRING is just as state-less and easy to use as the existing
STRING atom (which is reserved exclusively for ISO 8859-1 strings and
therefore not usable for UTF-8), and adding a new selection target
allows applications to offer selections in both the old CTEXT and the
new UTF8_STRING format simultaneously, which maximizes
interoperability. The use of UTF8_STRING can be negociated between the
selection holder and requestor, leading to no compatibility issues
whatsoever. Markus Kuhn has prepared an <a href=3D"http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/=
~mgk25/ucs/icccm.diff">ICCCM
patch</a> that adds the necessary definition to the standard. Current
status: The UTF8_STRING atom has now been officially <a href=3D"ftp://ftp.x=
.org/pub/DOCS/registry">registered</a> with X.Org,
and we hope for an update of the ICCCM in one of the next releases.

</p></li><li><b>Application window properties:</b> In order to assist the
window manager in correctly labeling windows, the <a href=3D"ftp://ftp.x.or=
g/pub/X11R7.0/doc/PDF/icccm.pdf">ICCCM 2.0</a>
specification requires applications to assign properties such as
WM_NAME, WM_ICON_NAME and WM_CLIENT_MACHINE to each window. The old
ICCCM 2.0 (1993) defines these to be of the polymorphic type TEXT,
which means that they can have their text encoding indicated using one
of the property types STRING (ISO 8859-1), COMPOUND_TEXT (a ISO 2022
subset), or C_STRING (unknown character set). Simply adding
UTF8_STRING as a new option for TEXT would break backwards
compatibility with old window managers that do not know about this
type. Therefore, the <a href=3D"http://freedesktop.org/Standards/">freedesk=
top.org draft
standard</a> developped in the <a href=3D"http://freedesktop.org/Standards/=
wm-spec">Window Manager
Specification Project</a> adds new additional window properties
_NET_WM_NAME, _NET_WM_ICON_NAME, etc. that have type UTF8_STRING.

</li><li id=3D"xfontstruct"><b>Inefficient font data structures:</b>
The Xlib API and X11 protocol data structures used for representing
font metric information are extremely inefficient when handling
sparsely populated fonts. The most common way of accessing a font in
an X client is a call to XLoadQueryFont(), which allocates memory for
an XFontStruct and fetches its content from the server. XFontStruct
contains an array of XCharStruct entries (12 bytes each). The size of
this array is the code position of the last character minus the code
position of the first character plus one. Therefore, any
=E2=80=9C*-iso10646-1=E2=80=9D font that contains both U+0020 and U+FFFD wi=
ll cause an
XCharStruct array with 65502 elements to be allocated (even for
CharCell fonts), which requires 786 kilobytes of client-side memory
and data transmission, even if the font contains only a thousand
characters.

<p>A few workarounds have been used so far:</p>

<ul>

<li>The non-Asian <samp>-misc-fixed-*-iso10646-1</samp> fonts that
come with XFree86 4.0 contain no characters above U+31FF. This reduces
the memory requirement to 153 kilobytes, which is still bad, but much
less so. (There are actually many useful characters above U+31FF
present in the BDF files, waiting for the day when this problem will
be fixed, but they currently all have an encoding of -1 and are
therefore ignored by the X server. If you need these characters, then
just install the <a href=3D"http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/ucs-fonts.html">=
original fonts</a> without
applying the <samp>bdftruncate</samp> script).

</li><li>Starting with XFree86 4.0.3, the truncation of a BDF font can also
be done by specifying a character code subrange at the end of the
XLFD, as described in the <a href=3D"ftp://ftp.x.org/pub/R6.4/xc/doc/hardco=
py/XLFD/xlfd.PS.gz">XLFD
specification</a>, section 3.1.2.12. For example,
<pre>-Misc-Fixed-Medium-R-Normal--20-200-75-75-C-100-ISO10646-1[0x1200_0x13=
7f]
</pre>
will load only the Ethiopic part of this BDF font with a
correspondingly nicely small XFontStruct. Earlier X server versions
will simply ignore the font subset brackets and will give you the full
font, so there is no compatibility problem with using that.

</li><li>Bruno Haible has written a BIGFONT protocol extension for XFree86
4.0, which uses a compressed transmission of XCharStruct from server
to client and also uses shared memory in Xlib between several clients
which have loaded the same font.

</li></ul>

<p>These workarounds do not solve the underlying problem that
XFontStruct is unsuitable for sparsely populated fonts, but they do
provide a significant efficiency improvement without requiring any
changes in the API or client source code. One real solution would be
to extend or replace XFontStruct with something slightly more flexible
that contains a sorted list or hash table of characters as opposed to
an array. This redesign of XFontStruct would at the same time also
allow the addition of the urgently needed provisions for combining
characters and ligatures.

</p><p>Another approach would be to introduce a new font encoding, which
could be called for instance =E2=80=9CISO10646-C=E2=80=9D (the C stands for=
 combining,
complex, compact, or character-glyph mapped, as you prefer). In this
encoding, the numbers assigned to each glyph are really font-specific
glyph numbers and are not equivalent to any UCS character code
positions. The information necessary to do a character-to-glyph
mapping would have to be stored in to be standardized new properties.
This new font encoding would be used by applications together with a
few efficient C functions that perform the character-to-glyph code
mapping:

</p><ul>

<li><samp>makeiso10646cglyphmap(XFontStruct *font, iso10646cglyphmap
*map)</samp>

<br>Reads the character-to-glyph mapping table from the font
properties into a compact and efficient in-memory representation.

</li><li><samp>freeiso10646cglyphmap(iso10646cglyphmap *map)</samp>

<br>Frees that in-memory representation.

</li><li><samp>mbtoiso10646c(char *string, iso10646cglyphmap *map, XChar2b
*output)</samp>

<br><samp>wctoiso10646c(wchar_t *string, iso10646cglyphmap *map,
XChar2b *output)</samp><br>These take a Unicode character string and
convert it into a <samp>XChar2b</samp> glyph string suitable for
output by <samp>XDrawString16</samp> with the ISO10646-C font from
which the <samp>iso10646cglyphmap</samp> was extracted.

</li></ul>

<p>ISO10646-C fonts would still be limited to having not more than 64
<a href=3D"http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/Units/binary.html">kibi</a>glyphs,
but these can come from anywhere in UCS, not just from the BMP. This
solution also easily provides for glyph substitution, such that we can
finally handle the Indic fonts. It solves the huge-XFontStruct problem
of ISO10646-1, as XFontStruct grows now proportionally with the number
of glyphs, not with the highest characters. It could also provide for
simple overstriking combining characters, but then the glyphs for
combining characters would have to be stored with negative width
inside an ISO10646-C font. It can even provide support for variable
combining accent positions, by having several alternative combining
glyphs with accents at different heights for the same combining
character, with the ligature substitution tables encoding which
combining glyph to use with which base character.

</p><p>TODO: write specification for ISO10646-C properties, write sample
implementations of the mapping routines, and add these to xterm, GTK,
and other applications and libraries. Any volunteers?

</p></li><li><b>Combining characters:</b> The X11 specification does not
support combining characters in any way. The font information lacks
the data necessary to perform high-quality automatic accent placement
(as it is found, for example, in all TeX fonts). Various people have
experimented with implementing simplest overstriking combining
characters using zero-width characters with ink on the left side of
the origin, but details of how to do this exactly are unspecified
(e.g., are zero-width characters allowed in CharCell and Monospaced
fonts?) and this is therefore not yet widely established practice.

</li><li><b>Ligatures:</b> The Indic scripts need font file formats that
support ligature substitution, which is at the moment just as
completely out of the scope of the X11 specification as are combining
characters.

</li></ul>

<p>Several XFree86 team members have worked on these issues. <a href=3D"htt=
p://www.x.org/">X.Org</a>, the official successor of the X
Consortium and the Opengroup as the custodian of the X11 standards and
the sample implementation, has taken over the results or is still
considering them.

</p><p>With regard to the font related problems, the solution will
probably be to dump the old server-side font mechanisms entirely and
use instead <a href=3D"http://xfree86.org/">XFree86=E2=80=99s</a> new <a hr=

<ul>

<li>Copy-and-paste from a small file that lists your most commonly
used Unicode characters in a convenient and for your needs suitably

</li><li>Extend your keyboard mapping using xmodmap. This is particularly
convenient if your keyboard has an AltGr key, which is meant for
exactly this purpose (some US keyboards have instead of AltGr just a
right Alt key, others lack that key entirely unfortunately, in which
case some other key must be assigned the Mode_switch function). Write

and load it with "xmodmap ~/.Xmodmap" from your X11 startup script
into your X server. You will then find that you get with AltGr easily
the following new characters out of your keyboard:

</p></li><li><a href=3D"http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/volatile/ISO-14755.p=
df">ISO 14755</a> defines a
hexadecimal input method: Hold down both the Ctrl and Shift key while
typing the hexadecimal Unicode number. After releasing Ctrl and Shift,
you have entered the corresponding Unicode character.

<p>This is currently implemented in GTK+ 2, and works in applications
such as GNOME Terminal, Mozilla and Firefox.

<h3>Application-specific methods</h3>

<ul>

<li>In VIM, type Ctrl-V u followed by a hexadecimal number. Example:
Ctrl-V u 20ac

</li><li>In Microsoft Windows, press the Alt key while typing the decimal
Unicode number with a leading zero on the numeric keypad. Example:
press-Alt 08364 release-Alt

</li><li>In Microsoft Word, type a hexadecimal number and then press Alt+X
to turn it into the corresponding Unicode character. Example: 20ac Alt-X

a temporary migration path to UCS and will probably not survive for
